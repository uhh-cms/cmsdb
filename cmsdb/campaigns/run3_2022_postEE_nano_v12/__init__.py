"""
Common, analysis independent definition of the 2022 post-EE data-taking campaign
with datasets at NanoAOD tier in version 12. The 'post-EE' refers to data taken
after part of the positive ECAL endcap (EE+) had to be shut down because of a water
leak inside the detector in late 2022 (more details can be found at
https://cms.cern/news/problems-and-solutions-ecal-leak-story).
A corresponding set of MC samples was produced to simulate the effect of the missing
endcap region.

See https://python-order.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#analysis-campaign-and-config.

Dataset ids are identical to those in DAS (https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das).
